# RB Intern Case Study App

It is my first simple app written in Dart/Flutter, so the code is a bit messy (probably more than a bit). I know there are a few things i can improve, like extracting widgets' styles or whole widgets to Widget class. But, as it was my first real approach to Flutter, i did not do it for now.
